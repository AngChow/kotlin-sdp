## Creational Patterns

Creational patterns **encapsulate knowledge about concrete classes** the system use, **hide how instances of these classes 
are created** and **separate the system from how the objects are composed**.

- **Abstract Factory** provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying
their concrete classes. Client code works only with interfaces. Concrete factories are singletons
